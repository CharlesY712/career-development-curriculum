# Strengths & Storytelling Reflection Guidelines

Build on your professional story by thinking about how you're progressing at Turing. Answer the questions below in your own gist to use your StrengthsFinder themes to add to your story:

* Write 1-2 paragraphs about your StrengthsFinder themes: How have you seen yourself using these strengths at Turing? Has your understanding of these strengths changed since you first reflected on them? If so, how?

My themes are Analytical, Acheiever, Responsibility, Restorative, and Woo. I have been using my strengths to overcome and prevent challenges here at Turing. I use my responsibility to keep me from slacking off and having a social life. Acheiver makes me want to ace every project. Analytical helps my approach to learning new things. And Woo helps me build relationships so that reaching out to other for help is easier to do. My understanding of these strengths has not changed since I first reflected on them because I have taken many strengths finders over the past decade and am fully aware of my strengths and challenges.

* Write a story about your Turing experience so far: When have you struggled? How have you dealt with struggle? When have you succeeded at Turing? How did you accomplish those successes?

I have struggled pretty much every day here at turing. I am a slow learner because I need to analyze every peice of new information and constantly want to "go down the rabbit hole". Rabbit holes are fun, but not effecient use of time. I have dealt with my struggles by relying on fellow class mates to help explain things from a different viewpoint. I have suceeded in almost every project at the cost of sanity. Through late nights and determination I sacrified my health for the good of the grades.

* Answer the question: how does your Turing story end? Create a vision for your future and your career transition into being a junior developer.

My short sided turing story ends a with a job that doesn't have a terrible commute but also provides for my wife and future family. My long term goals for my future is to have a job that can have an appropiate work life balance with the potential to work remotely. Not so that I can sit on the beach sipping mai tais, so that I can be as loving of a husband and father as possible without having to "stay late at the office" or be "away for a business trip". Possibly even a flexable enough job that I can be physically healthy by working out in the morning or playing hockey on weekday nights without having to worry about what time I need to clock in to work.

* After you practice storytelling in the session, answer this question: What was particularly easy or difficult about telling your story? What are 1-2 steps that you can take to continue to improve your abilities to tell your story, talk about yourself with ease, and examine your strengths?

I find it very easy to tell my story. I have always lived my life as an open book willing to talk about anything, anywhere, anytime to anyone. However, what I struggle with is that my story isn't as enthralling because it doesnt end with a grandios dream of changing the world. I am a responsible acheiver and that is what I am here to do. However, to improve my sotry, I will discover an area of software development that I am most passionate about and also focus on the challenges I have overcome to make me appear as very desirable for hire.
